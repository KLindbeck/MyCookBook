    To your liking, if you want to add more ingredients feel free to do so
Set Chicken on baking pan 
    Preferibly a baking wire on top of a baking pan.
      This will ensure your drippings wont pool ont your Chicken
          If you want your drippings to pool that fine too. At my house we enjoy either!
Put your Chicken in the Oven for 20 minutes and bake!
  If you have Chicken with the skin on then after 20 minutes flip your Chicken over and bake an roughly an additional 20 

Enjoy!
