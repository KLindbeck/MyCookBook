This one comes from my Grandfather, it's a basic Salsa Verde with a Simple Rule, when in doubt add 2!
This recipe makes roughly 1 Jar of Salsa Verde for more just increase the ratios
Ingredients
6-8 Tomatillos
2 Jalapenos
2 Garlic Cloves
2 Anaheim Peppers
2 Limes
Cilantro
*Other Peppers can be added or substituted such as Hatch Chillies, Poblanos,
      Side Note: Original Recipe is 2 Jalapenos, 2 Serrano, 2 Anaheim and 2 Poblanos
      Side Note #2: Anything hotter than a Poblano you will need to add only 1 pepper as to not over power the salsa.

Instructions
1) Peel and wash your Tomatillos
2) Slice and Devein Jalapenos (and other peppers)
3) Cut a White Onion in Half and then cut 1 Half into a quarter
4) Peel 2 Cloves of Whole Garlic

7)  Broil for 6-8 minutes. Take all ingredients out EXCEPT your Tomatillos. Flip your tomatillos and broil again for another 6-8 minutes.
7a) If you have Hatch chilies place them into a plastic bag while they cool, after the cool off, rub the bag between your hands to allow the skin of the Hatch chilies to come off.
8) Once the Tomatillos are out, place them into a blender, with your Garlic, Onion, Jalapeños, Anaheim Peppers, and  Hatch Chilies, along with some of the oil left in your baking tray, and blend.
